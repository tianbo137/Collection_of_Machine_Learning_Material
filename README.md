This repository contains various basic and very useful learning material (at least for me) from the following courses:

* [NTU-HsuanTienLin-MachineLearningFoundation Part I（林轩田机器学习)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ntumlone-mathematicalfoundations)
* [NTU-HsuanTienLin-MachineLearningFoundation Part II（林轩田机器学习)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ntumlone-algorithmicfoundations)
* [Machine Learning Techniques (機器學習技法)](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-techniques)
* [李宏毅2020机器学习深度学习](https://www.bilibili.com/video/av94519857/)
* A collection of Python Notebooks to the book [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)


The first two courses is related to the following course:  [Caltech's Machine Learning Course - CS 156](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbyG85GZ0PI&list=PLD63A284B7615313A) by Professor Yaser Abu-Mostafa, with whom Prof Lin coauthored their textbook [Learning From Data](https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Data-Yaser-S-Abu-Mostafa/dp/1600490069). I highly recommend this book for people who are interested in the basics of statistical learning theory. 

The Last book by  Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, and Robert Tibshirani is intended for undergraduate student, and if you are interested in more advanced theoretical aspects of statistical learning, there is another book [The Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/). Similar books are [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Christopher Bishop](http://users.isr.ist.utl.pt/~wurmd/Livros/school/Bishop%20-%20Pattern%20Recognition%20And%20Machine%20Learning%20-%20Springer%20%202006.pdf) and [Machine Learning: a Probabilistic Perspective
by Kevin Murphy](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~murphyk/MLbook/) with roughly the same level of math sophistication.
